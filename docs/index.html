      // `WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming` to instantiate the wasm module,

      // viewed by simply opening `index.html` in a browser (with a `file://`
      // url), so it would fail if we were to call this function!
      //
      // Work around this for now by deleting the function to ensure that the
      // `no_modules.js` script doesn't have access to it. You won't need this
      // hack when deploying over HTTP.
